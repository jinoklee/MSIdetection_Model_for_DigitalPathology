###  MSI(Microsatellite instability) detection in Whole slide Image using deep learning  

 
* [Preprocessing WSI](https://github.com/jinoklee/Preprocessing_WSI)  
   Preprocessing steps before training/testing the deep learning model in 7 stages
* MSI score per WSI  
   Using a deep learning model to obtain the probability of MSI for each patch, then predicting the MSI score at the slide level.
